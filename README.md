This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app@latest`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ModRanjan/blogger.git  # for Clone
```

```
cd /blogger  # move to blogger directory
```

```
npm run dev  # install packege dependencies
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Vercel deployed [link]('https://blogger-olive.vercel.app/).

#### Recomendation :

1. I haven't implemented form validation, we can implement them with formik and zod library.
2. I have made all field of the create Blog compulsory. We may make some field optional (field like tags, banner).
